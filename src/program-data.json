      "description": "A playful world of shadow puppetry, appearing as live cartoons, full of odd-ball characters and surreal events. Having toured all over the world, the award-winning Bunk Puppets will bring to life flying Ninjas, sneaky chickens and hilarious brain surgery! It's a visual feast for the imagination! Shadow puppet characters are assembled on the spot from household items, old toys, bits of fluff and card, and transformed into live cartoons on screen. This clever show is a celebration of play and creativity, with the audience seeing puppetry performed in front of the screen and receiving a cheeky peek into how theatrical wizardry is performed. Come play in the dark!"
